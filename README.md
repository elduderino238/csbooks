# books

This is just a repository of many of the books and resources I have found helpful in my journey as a hobbyist programmer. Some of these books are targeted towards beginners while others are more high-level and focused
on specific topics like digital signal processing and scientific computing. Additionally, some manuals help explain certain high-level topics such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
